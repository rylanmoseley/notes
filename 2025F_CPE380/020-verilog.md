# Verilog

We use Icarus Verilog (open source). We have a web-based Icarus Verilog compiler.

## What's a HDL

They express complex circuit design.

Target scale: FPGA or custom chips, maaybe board-level

We're discussing theoretical complete systems in Verilog.

Chip components
- silicon ingot: a pure, perfect crystal of silicon
- wafer: a slice of silicon
- die: one chip's area on a wafer
- chip: a mounted die
- yield: how many are good
- Scale Integration

Both the design and the test for the design are written in the HDL
