## Instantaneous Power

- Power absorbed or supplied by an element
- Passive sign convention: "power" is power *consumed*
    - an element supplying power "consumes negative power", so a source has a negative instantaneous power
    - an element consuming power consumes positive power, and has a positive instantaneous power
    - a resistor *always* consumes power, always has a positive instantaneous power
- $P = V \cdot I$
- Power is a function of time: $P(t) = V(t) \cdot I(t)$

## Conservation of Power

- $\sum p = 0$
- all power that is produced must be absorbed and all power that is absorbed must be produced
- for a circuit or an element, the total power must sum to 0
- example: "find the total power consumed by a circuit"
    - option 1: convert phasors to time, find the voltage and current for every element, find the total power
    - option 2: find the power produced by the sources, invert it
    - good for checking work
- if impedence is complex, you cannot use Ohm's law in time-domain
    - convert time-domain to phasor, *then* apply Ohm's law
    - basically everything needs to be in the same domain
    - then convert back from phasor to time-domain for the solution if needed
- complex impedence may introduce elements that are out of phase
    - out of phase power just includes multiple $\cos$ functions
- **watch units on angles**: only add numbers of the same units, make sure your sine and cosine functions are set to the same units you're passing to them

For a **resistive load** with resistance $R$:
$$
p_R(t) = v(t) \cdot i(t) = \frac {v^2(t)} R = i^2(t) \cdot R
$$
This only applies to resistance, *not impedence*

## Phasor Algebra
Addition (or subtraction in the same way):
$$
C_1 + C_2 = (A_1 + A_2) + j (B_1 + B_2)
$$

Complex Conjugation:
$$
C = M \angle \phi
$$
$$
C* = M \angle - \phi
$$
or:
$$
C = A + jB
$$
$$
C* = A - jB
$$

Multiplication:
$$
C_1 \cdot C_2 = ( M_1 \cdot M_2 ) ~ \angle ~ ( \phi_1 + \phi_2 )
$$

Division:
$$
\frac {C_1} {C_2} = \frac {M_1} {M_2} ~ \angle ~ (\phi_1 - \phi_2)
$$

## Steady-state AC

$$
v(t) = V_m cos( \omega t + \phi_v )
$$
$$
i(t) = I_m cos( \omega t + \phi_i )
$$
$$
p(t) = v(t) \cdot i(t) = V_m cos( \omega t + \phi_v ) \cdot I_m cos( \omega t + \phi_i )
$$
$$
p(t) = V_m I_m cos( \omega t + \phi_v ) cos( \omega t + \phi_i ) = V_m I_m cos(\alpha) cos(\beta)
$$
$$
cos(\alpha) cos(\beta) = \frac 1 2 [ cos(\alpha - \beta) + cos(\alpha + \beta) ]
$$
$$
p(t) = \frac {V_m I_m} 2 cos(\phi_v - \phi_i) + \frac {V_m I_m} 2 cos( 2 \omega t + \phi_v + \phi_i )
$$

average power = $\frac {V_m I_m} 2 cos(\phi_v - \phi_i)$ because the second term is a cosine wave (vertically symmetric about zero)

## Time-Average Power

The "time average power" is the average power over one period.

The steady-state AC power function is made up of a time-dependent and a time-independent term. The time average power is just the constant, time-independent term.

The time average power is *more important than the instantaneous power*.

The general form that **applies to any waveform** is:
$$
p_{ave} = \frac 1 T \int_0^T p(t)~dt
$$

The phasor equation that **applies only to sinusoidal signals** is:
$$
P_{ave} = \frac {V_m I_m} 2 \cos (\phi_v - \phi_i)
$$
**MEMORIZE THAT**

The phase difference ($\phi_v - \phi_i$) plays a role in average power.

For a resistive load, the voltage and current are in phase and $\phi_v - \phi_i = 0$ (and $\cos ( 0 ) = 1$ )

$$
P_{ave_R} = \frac {V_m I_m} 2
$$

If an element is purely inductive or capacitive, the phase difference will be $\pm 90 \degree$ (and $\cos (\pm 90) = 0$)

For a capacitive or inductive element or load:
$$
P_{ave} = 0
$$

A capactive or inductive element produces as much as it consumes during a cycle, for a net 0.

$$
V = Z \cdot I
$$
$$
V_L = j \omega L \cdot I
$$
$$
V_C = -j \frac 1 {\omega C} \cdot I
$$

The instantaneous power may be zero or nonzero, but the time average power over a single period will always be 0.

> reminder:
> $$
\omega = \frac {2 \pi} T$$
> $$
T = \frac {2 \ pi} \omega$$

If possible, the phasor method is easier and faster. Only use integration when the signal is not sinusoidal.

Special form for **resistors only**
$$
P_{ave_R} = \frac {V_m I_m} 2 = \frac {V^2_m} {2R} = \frac 1 2 I^2_m R
$$

For a complex load:
$$
\overline V = \overline I \cdot \overline Z = I_m |\overline Z| \angle (\phi_I + \phi_Z)
$$
$$
\phi_V = \phi_I + \phi_Z
$$

The phasors of I and V:
$$
\overline V = V_m \angle \phi_V
$$
$$
\overline I = I_m \angle \phi_I
$$

Compelex Conjugate: for
$$
\overline I = a + bi
$$
$$
\overline I* = a - bi
$$


Re() operator is "find the real part only"

$$
P_{ave} = \frac 1 2 Re( \overline V ~ \overline I* )
$$

"P" is "real power", which is average power

$$
\overline I* = \frac {\overline V*} {\overline Z*}
$$

$$
\overline V ~ \overline V* = |\overline V|^2
$$

$$
P = \frac 1 2 Re( \frac {|\overline V|^2} {\overline Z*}  )
$$
$$
P = \frac 1 2 |I|^2 R
$$

## Maximum Power Transfer
$P = \frac 1 2 i^2 \cdot R$

but $P_{ave} = i^2 \cdot R$

To find the maximum power in a load, the load impedence needs to match the complex conjgate of the source impedence.

Find the source impedence by removing all independent sources (voltage source -> wire, current source -> open circuit, dependent sources stay) and calculating the equivalent impedence. Find the complex conjugate, and make the that the load's impedence.

This means that any resistor in the source will be mirrored in the load and any capacitor or inductor in the source will be mirrored by the opposite one, with an impedence negative that of the source.

The maximum power transfer happens when $Z_{load} = Z_{source}*$.

## RMS or Effective Value
- Find the period ($T$)
- square the signal
- integrate the squared signal over one period
- divide the integral by T
- square root the result

$$
rms(~ X(t) ~) = X_{rms}(t) = \sqrt \frac {\int_{T_0}^{T_1} (X(t)^2) ~ dt} {T}
$$

RMS = Root Mean Square

The square root of the mean of the squared signal over one period.

The apparent power is $V_{rms} \cdot I_{rms}$ in $V \cdot A$ or volt-amperes, **NOT WATTS**

## Nonideal Voltage Source

A real, nonideal voltage source is "made" with an ideal voltage source in series with a Resistor, which is the internal resistance.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	% Paths, nodes and wires:
	\draw (1, 8) to[american voltage source, l={$V_{source}$}] (1, 5);
	\draw (1, 8) to[american resistor, l_={$R_{internal}$}] (3, 8);
	\draw (3, 8) -- (5, 8);
	\draw (1, 5) -- (5, 5);
	\node[circ] at (5, 8){};
	\node[circ] at (5, 5){};
	\node[shape=rectangle, draw, line width=1pt, dash pattern={on 1pt off 4pt}, minimum width=3.965cm, minimum height=4.965cm] at (2, 6.5){};
	\node[shape=rectangle, minimum width=4.215cm, minimum height=1.215cm] at (2.625, 9.375){} node[anchor=north west, align=left, text width=3.827cm, inner sep=6pt] at (0.5, 10){Nonideal Voltage Source};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

## Ideal and Nonideal Meter

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	% Paths, nodes and wires:
	\draw (1, 10) to[rmeterwa, l={$M_{ideal}$}] (1, 7);
	\draw (1, 6) to[rmeterwa, l={$M_{nonideal}$}] (1, 3);
	\node[shape=rectangle, minimum width=4.965cm, minimum height=1.965cm] at (5.75, 8.131){} node[anchor=north west, align=left, text width=4.577cm, inner sep=6pt] at (3.25, 9.131){Has no effect on the circuit. Does not change any value.};
	\node[shape=rectangle, minimum width=5.465cm, minimum height=1.965cm] at (6, 3.88){} node[anchor=north west, align=left, text width=5.077cm, inner sep=6pt] at (3.25, 4.88){Affects the circuit in some way.};
	\draw (1, 10) to[american resistor, l_={$R_{meter}= \infty ~\Omega$}] (1, 12);
	\draw (1, 3) to[american resistor, l={$R_{meter}<\infty~\Omega$}] (1, 1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

A nonideal meter has some resistance $R_{meter}$ that is less than the ideal $\infty$ but is still very large. Ideally, the value is as large as possible.

$$
V_B = V_S \frac {R_x} {R_x + R_s}
$$

## Complex Power

The Power Factor is $pf = \frac {P_{ave}} {V_{rms} I_{rms}}$

$$
pf = \cos(\phi_V - \phi_I)
$$

if $\phi_V - \phi_I > 0$, current lags behind voltage.

$$
pf = \cos (\phi_{load})
$$
If it's leading, capacitive load. if it's lagging, inductive load.

$$
P_{ave} = V_{rms} I_{rms} \times pf
$$
