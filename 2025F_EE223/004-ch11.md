## Instantaneous Power

- Power absorbed or supplied by an element
- Passive sign convention: "power" is power *consumed*
    - an element supplying power "consumes negative power", so a source has a negative instantaneous power
    - an element consuming power consumes positive power, and has a positive instantaneous power
    - a resistor *always* consumes power, always has a positive instantaneous power
- $P = V \cdot I$
- Power is a function of time: $P(t) = V(t) \cdot I(t)$

## Conservation of Power

- $\sum p = 0$
- all power that is produced must be absorbed and all power that is absorbed must be produced
- for a circuit or an element, the total power must sum to 0
- example: "find the total power consumed by a circuit"
    - option 1: convert phasors to time, find the voltage and current for every element, find the total power
    - option 2: find the power produced by the sources, invert it
    - good for checking work
- if impedence is complex, you cannot use Ohm's law in time-domain
    - convert time-domain to phasor, *then* apply Ohm's law
    - basically everything needs to be in the same domain
    - then convert back from phasor to time-domain for the solution if needed
- //TODO dividing phasors?
- complex impedence may introduce elements that are out of phase
    - out of phase power just includes multiple $\cos$ functions
- **watch units on angles**: only add numbers of the same units, make sure your sine and cosine functions are set to the same units you're passing to them

For a **resistive load** with resistance $R$:
$$
p_R(t) = v(t) \cdot i(t) = \frac {v^2(t)} R = i^2(t) \cdot R
$$
This only applies to resistance, *not impedence*

## Steady-state AC

$$
v(t) = V_m cos( \omega t + \phi_v )
$$
$$
i(t) = I_m cos( \omega t + \phi_i )
$$
$$
p(t) = v(t) \cdot i(t) = V_m cos( \omega t + \phi_v ) \cdot I_m cos( \omega t + \phi_i )
$$
$$
p(t) = V_m I_m cos( \omega t + \phi_v ) cos( \omega t + \phi_i ) = V_m I_m cos(\alpha) cos(\beta)
$$
$$
cos(\alpha) cos(\beta) = \frac 1 2 [ cos(\alpha - \beta) + cos(\alpha + \beta) ]
$$
$$
p(t) = \frac {V_m I_m} 2 cos(\phi_v - \phi_i) + \frac {V_m I_m} 2 cos( 2 \omega t + \phi_v + \phi_i )
$$
* average power = $\frac {V_m I_m} 2 cos(\phi_v - \phi_i)$ because the second term is a cosine wave (vertically symmetric about zero)
