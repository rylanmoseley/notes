## Chapters 9 & 10
Review of topics covered in EE211

//TODO review heavily

//TODO check against posted notes

- complex number algebra (phasors)
    - euler's identity $e^{j \theta} = \cos ~\theta + j~ \sin ~\theta$
    - mode of a complex number //TODO get equation for this
    - //TODO there was a 3rd one

    - converting betweek phasor form and time domain
    - phasor diagram

- using matlab
- component models
    - inductor, capacitor, resistor
    - time and frequency domain
    - //TODO get formulas from notes
    - passive sign convention

- nodal analysis
- loop analysis
    
- "most of our problems are simple and mostly impedance combination"
- "there may be a few problems with mltiple nodes or loops, but they will not be on exams"

- "basically quiz problem" on slides
    - ohm's law applied to ac components

- $f \cdot  2 \pi= \omega~$ where $f$ is in hz and $\omega$ is in rad //TODO check
- time domain $v(t) = m \cos (\omega + x)$, note the omega is *frequency and not time*
