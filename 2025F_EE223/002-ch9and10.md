Review of topics covered in EE211

## complex numbers
- Imaginary unit: $j = \sqrt{-1}$
- A complex number in rectangular form: $a+jb$
- That same number in polar form: $D \angle \phi$
- that same number in exponential form: $De^{j \phi}$

$$
D = \sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 }
$$
$$
\phi = \tan^{-1} ( \frac{b}{a} )
$$
$$
a = D \cos ( \phi )
$$
$$
b = D \sin ( \phi )
$$

- euler's identity: $e^{j \theta} = \cos ~\theta + j~ \sin ~\theta$
- mode of a complex number: $|a + jb| = \sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 }$ (basically magnitude)
- the phase of a complex number: $\angle ( a + jb ) = \tan^{-1} ( \frac b a )$

## Phasors

A phasor is a representation of a time domain signal with an implied frequency.

Phasors are in **cosine**, so the initial phase angle ($\phi$) needs to be subtracted by $90 \degree$

$$
v(t) = 20 \sin ( 377t + 30 \degree )
$$
$$
\overline V = 20 \angle ( 30 \degree - 90 \degree ) = 20 \angle (-60 \degree)
$$

## AC Steady-State Analysis for RLC Circuits

$$
Z_i = j \omega L
$$
$$
Z_c = \frac 1 {j \omega C}
$$
$$
Z_r = R
$$

Impedence is combined **the same as** resistance, by adding the impedences of elements in series and taking the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of each element's impedence in parallel.

Ohm's law applies: $V = I Z$

### Nodal Analysis

Unknowns: nodal voltages

KCL applies: $\sum i_{node} = 0$

All currents coming into a node and going out of a node sum to 0.

Ohm's law applies.

### Loop Analysis

Unknowns: loop currents

KVL applies: $\sum v_{loop} = 0$

All voltage drops around a loop sum to zero.

Ohm's law applies.

### Professor's comments

- "most of our problems are simple and mostly impedance combination"
- "there may be a few problems with mltiple nodes or loops, but they will not be on exams"

### Extra notes

$\omega$ is in **radians per second** and will probably need to be converted to degrees contextually. **Watch units!** Check calculator units!
