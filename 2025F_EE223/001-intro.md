# Intro

## Lab needs
- labs are in groups of 2
    - submissions are individual, but the work is done together
- get a physical notebook
    - something about 2 copies?
        - //TODO email for clarification later maybe?
        - duplicate each page
        - carbon copy notebook?
    - "we want to see your work, cross things out if they're wrong"
        - leave mistake crossed out but legible
        - mistakes won't effect grade
