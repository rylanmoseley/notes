# Chapter 2

Resistance is the aversion to the flow of electicity.

$$
R = \rho \frac l A
$$
where $R$ is resistance, $\rho$ is resistivity, $l$ is the length, and $A$ is the cross-section area.

## Ohm's Law
$$
V = I R
$$

Current and voltage are related to each other and change based on resistance.

An open circuit has infinite resistance, and a closed circuit (a wire) has zero resistance (for the purposes of this class).

Some resistors are variable.

Some resistors do not obey Ohm's Law and are nonlinear.

## Conductance

Conductance is the opposite of resistance and measured in Mhos (inverted $\Omega$) (who did they let name that).
