# Ch1 mtg notes

## Voltage

potential energy across an element or between nodes. Has polarity, labelled +/- for higher/lower potential

Positive node - negative node = potential difference

![Circuit with two points and a voltage drop](image.png){width=160px}

(assuming $v_{ab}$ = 9V)

$$
v_a - v_b = 9V = v_{ab}
$$

$$
v_b - v_a = v_{ba} = -9V
$$

Measuring *from* the positive node *to* the negative node.

**$v_b$ or the negative node is "$0$".**

## Current

## Loads

Loads absorb/use/consume/dissipate **positive power**

examples:

- resistor
- network of resistors
- etc

## Sources

Sources generate/produce/provide power.

Sources *absorb* **negative** power.

Independent source: circle
Dependent source: diamond

Current and Voltage sources can be either Independent or Dependent.

Dependent sources can be controlled by a voltage or current, regardless of their output. A voltage-controlled voltage source, for example, scales a voltage value derived from some other part of the circuit and outputs that as voltage.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	% Paths, nodes and wires:
	\draw (1, 10.5) to[american voltage source, l={$x$}] (3, 10.5);
	\draw (1, 9) to[american current source, l={$x$}] (3, 9);
	\draw (1, 7) to[american controlled voltage source, l={$\alpha V_x$}] (3, 7);
	\draw (1, 5) to[american controlled voltage source, l={$\alpha I_x$}] (3, 5);
	\draw (1, 3) to[american controlled current source, l={$\alpha V_x$}] (3, 3);
	\draw (1, 1) to[american controlled current source, l={$\alpha I_x$}] (3, 1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

From top to bottom:

- voltage source
- current source
- voltage-controlled voltage source
- current-controlled voltage source
- voltage-controlled current source
- current-controlled current source

$\alpha$ is in whatever units are needed for the output.

## Active and Passive elements

Active elements generate power

Passive elements consume power

We refer to "power" as **power consumed**
